# Ribisi_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for csci2270 spring 2016, video game
a video game that uses graphs and an inventory to trade items with npcs to beat the end of the game. To run the code all you have to do is type './final' on the terminal window and it was start up. The command the game recognizes are 'go <direction>', 'look', 'talk', 'look at map', 'look in bag', 'buy <item>', 'trade', 'pick up', 'fight', 'leave', and 'q' to quit. All commands, directions, and items will be lower cased and IS CASE SENSITIVE. If you make any changes: Save them, then type 'make' in the terminal window. You might get some warning but as long as there are no syntax errors, it will compile a new final executable. Graph.h is where all my structs are, and the too classes, Graph and Bag. Graph.cpp is the functions for both those classes. finalProject.cpp is the main file where all the printing and location tracking occurs.

## Issues
1. Quite a few spelling errors, which are a bit distracting. I think you mean 'ladle', not 'laddle'. 
2. Hard to get started, would be really helpful if there was some kind of "Help" function which explained what the functions did.
